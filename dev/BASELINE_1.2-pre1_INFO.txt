MontrixBot 1.2-pre1 BASELINE clean

This archive is a cleaned baseline derived from MontrixBot_1.1-SIGNALS_1.1.2-polish2-fixed:

- Removed all __pycache__ folders and .pyc files.
- Moved patch notes, multi-step READMEs and docs/* under dev/.
- Moved runtime logs and snapshots (json/jsonl, safe_unlock.key, exchange_info snapshot) under dev/runtime_snapshot/.
- Moved user .env with real keys to dev/archive/env_user_snapshot.env.
- Kept .env.example, core/, ui/, tools/, scripts/, telegram/, runtime/ code and configs.
- Updated VERSION to 1.2-pre1.

Use this as the starting point for 1.2-pre1 development.
